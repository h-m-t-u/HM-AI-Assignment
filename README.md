# HM-AI-Assignment

This dataset has data for credit card transactions and the analysis is to determine questions about whether there is fraudulent ones and how to discern them. 

A very useful use of AI was that when I often do not remember the precise formatting of a particular command or the wording of a particular function. AI of course knows all the correct language. 
Also, when I know there exists a particular function or command that I want to use, but I cannot put a finger on the name or correct usage, AI can help me figure it out with my vaguely remembered descriptions. 
However, the danger with someone who does not know how do conduct a proper analysis or properly analyze the results using AI, is that they will present completely misinterpreted answers. So, having a proper understanding of the code prevents that. Also if you use AI to problem solve, you are left with a weak brain, shamefully crutched on a pedantic and human dependent computer. 
When I asked for a percentage analysis I had to verify it because AI presented it in a way I did not understand.
